1.1)
	Some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer's testing level 2 to testing level 4 are:
- Not scare of showing failures and always try to correct/minimize them.
- Having confidence on the software if no failures are found after thoroughly examing the software.
- Testers team and developers team are on the same page.
- Not using existing support program just to use it on face value but to improve team capabilities of some sort of skill that the program support.

	“Level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk” means at level 3 the main goal is to reduce/minimize the number of possible failure
could happen because not only the software could have error and fault but there may also happen problems when our machines run the software. So that why you want
to reduce/minimize as many posibilities of a failure occured as posible. That is the risk we are talking about, and we can't reduce it to zero because simply there
is no way to do that in practical since risk always there no matter how small or how big it or its consequences are.
