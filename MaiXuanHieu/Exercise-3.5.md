According to RIPR model we have:

 - Reachability: Only the first element can be reached when a fault happen.
  
 - Infection: Error can happen when fault is present.
  
 - Propagation: The final state actually still is correct for Alex to be the first element but not the other elements.
  
 - Revealability: The tester (here is the asserTrue) can't observe and reveal the fault.
